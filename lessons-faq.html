The student is also given a broad overview of the skills and understanding they will develop and the timeline of progress for a typical beginner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">INTRO TO BASIC PROCEDURES AND DAILY PRACTICE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are introduced to basic practices that they can begin to use to restore the healthy functioning of the primary control, typically experienced as a release of muscle tension, a natural realignment and integration of body parts, and a “light” feeling of effortlessness and well-being. The most important concept for the student to understand at this point is how using directive thinking in a detached, intentional way will lead to the automatic reorganization of the postural system - with muscles toning up or releasing tension in accordance with the body’s natural design. The basic procedure here is the “lie-down” or “semi-supine position”, which the student can begin to use in conjunction with directive thinking on a daily basis (about 15-45 minutes is recommended for beginners).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXPLORING INTERMEDIATE-ADVANCED PROCEDURES AND CONCEPTS</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After familiarity with directive thinking and some basic procedures is established, the student should have an improvement in their overall coordination and muscle tone, and their kinesthetic and proprioceptive perception will be heightened by these improvements. At this time more specific domains can be explored, such as the use of the voice or basic actions such as walking or sitting down. Approaching more dynamic procedures allows for the introduction of more advanced concepts such as the means-whereby principle and inhibition, which ultimately will allow the student to achieve a high degree of effortlessness in any action they choose to study. This is where maintaining a foundational practice such as daily lie-downs becomes important, as all of the more advanced work the student explores will be built upon the improvements they continue to make using these fundamental practices. Building independence in self-study is critical here as well, and the student will learn how to organize their practice and maintain a healthy, self-compassionate mindset for making gradual progress. This is ultimately what will allow the student to continue making use of what they have learned regardless of whether they continue to take lessons in the future.</span></p></div></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://newdirectionsat.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
